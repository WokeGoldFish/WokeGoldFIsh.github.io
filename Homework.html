                <p>
                    I am not to sure how to make individual boxes like was shown on the example?

                    But, the main reason I decided to change focus into webdesign and coding was because I no longer had the desire to go to law school!
                    I realized that going back to for gradschool would only make me more unhappy and I was only doing it because it would make my parents happy.
                    So I decided that it was time for a change and I was always interested in coding and more than happy to learn something new!
